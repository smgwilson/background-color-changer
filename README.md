### Write a Javascript module with the following specs:
-- When executed, it will change browser background to a random color every second. 
-- Colors should not repeat.  (i.e. once a color is used, donâ€™t use it again)
-- Stop changing the color after 10 seconds.
-- You should be able to npm install it and import it to be used.

## TODO
-- Write tests
